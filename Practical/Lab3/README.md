# Lab 3 - Singleton Design Pattern
In singleton design pattern, we define a class that has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it. In this, a class must ensure that only single instance should be created and single object can be used by all other classes.

There are two forms of singleton design pattern.
1. Early Instantiation: creation of instance at load time
2. Lazy Instantiation: creation of instance when required.
